# Internal Tide analysis in NEMO run eNATL60

## Organisation of the repository
* docs: working documents and notes
* code: python packages developed for the analysis
* training: folder for trials et al (sandbox for root directory)
* dev_notebooks: notebook used for developping some of the routines (sandbox for code/)
* tutos: notebooks illustrating the use of the various analysis code and routines written

Processing notebooks (in clean form) should be at the root of the repository.

### Work in progress
* compute mean fields from eNATL: AP leading, see __averaging__ branch
* working on sub-region near the Acores (west of Great Meteor Seamount). See __METEOR__ branch.
* Compute and project vertical modes (now in __METEOR__ branch, work on local dataset. WIP: extend it to full domain computation)
