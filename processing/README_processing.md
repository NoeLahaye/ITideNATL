This folder contains scripts and notebooks that allows to compute vertical modes and project the dynamical fields on this basis.

* `pre_proj`: compute mean stratification, as well as mean density and mean pressure (these are not mandatory for the rest of the computation), and the mean (vertical) grids.
* `projection`: compute vertical modes (at `T` points, `u` points and `v` points).
