## Processing

This folder contains sub-directory for computing the vertical modes (and required mean grid and stratification prior to that) and project the dynamical fields on this basis.

* **pre_proj/**: compute mean stratification, as well as mean density and mean pressure (these are not mandatory for the rest of the computation), and the mean (vertical) grids. Compute vertical modes
* **projection/**: project pressure and horizontal fields onto the vertical modes
* **testings/**: for testing stuff...
