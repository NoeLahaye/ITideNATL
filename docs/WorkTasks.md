## Work in progress
* compute mean state -> stratification. Mean temperature and salinity from eNATL done. Todo: $N^2$
* Compute vertical modes
* project fields on vertical modes
* time-filter / harmonic analyis

### METEOR branch:
* working on sub-region near the Acores (west of Great Meteor Seamount). See __METEOR__ branch.
* Compute and project vertical modes (now in __METEOR__ branch, work on local dataset. WIP: extend it to full domain computation)
